## What’s Inside

- **Data**: VASP inputs and outputs (POSCAR, CONTCAR, DOSCAR, etc.) used in the study.  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter notebook for post-processing, plotting, and figure generation.  

The aim is to provide transparency and allow other researchers to **reproduce figures, verify results, and reuse workflows**.
